# Adding RG-DS Device Tree Files

These files need to be added to U-Boot (not patches, new files):

## 1. Main Device Tree
Copy to: u-boot/dts/upstream/src/arm64/rockchip/rk3568-anbernic-rg-ds.dts
Source: Decompiled from working /boot/rk3568-anbernic-rg-ds.dtb

## 2. U-Boot Additions
Copy to: u-boot/arch/arm/dts/rk3568-anbernic-rg-ds-u-boot.dtsi
Content: Standard RK356x U-Boot additions (SARADC for device detection, boot order)

## Files included in this directory:
- rk3568-anbernic-rg-ds.dts - Main device tree
- rk3568-anbernic-rg-ds-u-boot.dtsi - U-Boot specific additions (copy from u-boot/arch/arm/dts/)
- rk3568-anbernic-rg-ds.dtb - Original compiled DTB from device (for reference)
